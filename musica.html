        <h3>1. Look At Me Now - TryHardNinja</h3>

        The children gather 'round<br>
        if they could only know<br>
        The nightmares that exist<br>
        Behind the happy show.<br>
        <br>
        I used to be just like them,<br>
        A smile across my face.<br>
        Until this place of innocence<br>
        Transformed into my cage.<br>
        <br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        Prisoner inside of the body I possess.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        Teaming with power, I will tear into your flesh.<br>
        <br>
        Forever walk the darkness chained,<br>
        Filled with growing rage.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        I'm just like you,<br>
        Both trapped with no hope to escape.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        <br>
        Call me bitter,<br>
        Or a killer,<br>
        And anything else that you want to.<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I live too long unforgiven,<br>
        And said goodbye to my heaven,<br>
        In the darkness I have risen,<br>
        I'm content to be the villain.<br>
        <br>
        Call me twisted,<br>
        Or a sinner,<br>
        Demon, monster, evil,<br>
        It's all true<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you look at me<br>
        All you see<br>
        Is a dangerous machine,<br>
        Who am I to argue with it?<br>
        (Here comes a killing spree!)<br>
        <br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        Prisoner inside of the body I possess.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        Teaming with power, I will tear into your flesh.<br>
        <br>
        Forever walk the darkness chained,<br>
        Filled with growing rage.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        I'm just like you,<br>
        Both trapped with no hope to escape.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        <br>
        I am two sides of a face,<br>
        And I don't feel that I can ever leave this place.<br>
        With any moment I'm a child<br>
        Or a demon filled with rage<br>
        (Look at me now!)<br>
        <br>
        The paths are still the same,<br>
        Our paths are still the same.<br>
        <br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        Prisoner inside of the body I possess.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        Teaming with power, I will tear into your flesh.<br>
        <br>
        Forever walk the darkness chained,<br>
        Filled with growing rage.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>
        I'm just like you,<br>
        Both trapped with no hope to escape.<br>
        Look at me now!<br>

        There's a shadow on the wall<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm <br>
        There's a figure in the hall<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm<br>
        <br>
        Keeps my wits and stay alive<br>
        Wish I had a 9-to-5<br>
        There's a stranger in us all<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm<br>
        <br>
        Every hair is on it's end<br>
        That's fine, I'm fine<br>
        Feeling my adrenaline<br>
        That's fine, I'm fine<br>
        <br>
        I can keep away the creeps<br>
        Safely from my swivel seat<br>
        Something's crawling through the vent<br>
        That's fine... uh-oh<br>
        <br>
        There's a ghost in the machine<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm<br>
        They are watching through the screen<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm<br>
        <br>
        They just might drive me crazy<br>
        Hit me!<br>
        <br>
        Hey kids, it's nice to meet ya<br>
        Are you ready for some Fazbear pizza?<br>
        Who's this, working at the night shift?<br>
        I don't know, but I don't think I like him<br>
        He's so cute! I can feel his heart racing<br>
        About time we had a brand new plaything<br>
        Another yellow belly balking like a chicken<br>
        Hey!<br>
        Listen gang, I say that we dig in<br>
        <br>
        They are slowly closing in<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm<br>
        Find an inner strength within<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm<br>
        <br>
        If I've learned one thing it's that<br>
        Don't respond to Craigslist ads<br>
        I can see their second skin<br>
        Stay calm, stay calm<br>
        <br>
        In the end, there's only me<br>
        All right, all right<br>
        Morning sun will set me free<br>
        All right, all right<br>
        <br>
        I spent five nights at Freddy's<br>
        Hit me!<br>
        <br>
        Hey, where did our new friend go?<br>
        Don't worry, he'll be back again tomorrow<br>
        So, uh, does he not go to the bathroom<br>
        Or does he just hold it in all night?<br>
        Aye, he pees into a cup<br>
        Ew!<br>
        I've seen him do it with me own eye<br>
        We were both just staring at each other<br>
        It was extremely awkward<br>

        Hear your voice in the monitor                              <br>
        And I don't know what to do<br>
        But I follow all your rules<br>
        Yeah<br>
        <br>
        Hear a knock and it's raining outside<br>
        I look in those eyes, I'm closin' those blinds<br>
        And I'm followin' your rules<br>
        Yeah<br>
        <br>
        Night comes<br>
        Freddy lets meet<br>
        Keep lights on<br>
        But I can't stand<br>
        There's knockin' like before<br>
        Bonnie's at the door<br>
        <br>
        Wake up<br>
        Foxy just left<br>
        Now Chica's<br>
        Creepin' on me<br>
        I can't sleep anymore<br>
        What's she waitin' for?<br>
        <br>
        How beautiful the night can be<br>
        I'm never getting any sleep<br>
        I'm losing all my sanity<br>
        Have you seen what I've seen?<br>
        <br>
        How beautiful the night can be<br>
        I'm living in a memory<br>
        I'm losing all my sanity<br>
        Have you seen what I've seen?<br>
        <br>
        An infant in a crib<br>
        With instructions to help me live<br>
        Innocent, what gives<br>
        In the dark and they start, fall apart, can I win?<br>
        Resist to quit<br>
        Look at the clock! Am I caught? Probably not<br>
        Many monsters jumpin' out at me, pretending that I'm not afraid, I gotta see if anything is killin' me<br>
        Stop!<br>
        <br>
        Creating all these memories are fading in the dark!<br>
        Debating with these robots infiltrating round the clock!<br>
        And I thought I lost (lost)<br>
        And the cradle rocks (rocks)<br>
        Got me stunned<br>
        Who can I trust? (trust, trust)<br>
        <br>
        Night comes<br>
        Freddy let's meet<br>
